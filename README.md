# Compliance tests for TOML

Language-agnostic tests for TOML implementations, for testing compliance with the TOML specification.

These tests provide a mechanism for implementations to verify that they are compliant with the TOML specification, without a "blessed" / reference implementation of TOML, to be taken as ground truth.

## Usage

Usage instructions, as well as other useful information about this repository can be found in the [documentation](docs/).

## Acknowledgements

This repository builds upon some excellent work done by:

- @BurntSushi: who initially designed this test format (!), and wrote tests for TOML 0.4.0.
- @sgarciac and @iarna: who wrote tests in this format, for TOML 0.5.0 as well as TOML 1.0.0-rc1!
